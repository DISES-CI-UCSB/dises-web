                                Over the past several decades, a global community of governments, indigenous groups, and NGOs have agreed to meet sustainable land use goals 
                                to mitigate the effects of climate change; however, few of these targets have been met as we face mounting challenges.

                                In Colombia, there is an urgent need to adopt policies that protect both human livelihoods and biodiversity. 
                                Colombia is the second most biodiverse country in the world and home to rare ecosystems.
                                However, increasing social inequity and a rising population have driven land use practices that threaten Colombiaâ€™s natural systems.
                                By partnering with the Alexander Von Humboldt Biological Resources Institute, this project aims to build upon existing scientific models and communities of practice to co-design integrated land use solutions that are politically salient.
