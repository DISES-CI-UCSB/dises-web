                        <p>We know the planet is warming, but most land use planning models are based on current conditions, and rarely account for future climate change even when certain interventions, such as siting new protected areas, are intended to protect against the effects of climate change. We are advancing land use forecasting models so that they include projections of biodiversity under climate change, as well as future energy transitions needed to meet sustainable development targets while also accounting for the need for increasing agricultural areas to sustain a growing human population. We are also responding to stakeholder needs by developing models that can be adjusted to reflect different land use prioritizations.</p>

                            <p>Global maps are often used to set biodiversity conservation targets and priorities because they can help overcome the data accessibility and capacity challenges of implementing decision support tools. However, they often lack national or local validation and may not be useful for countries tasked with implementing these policies. Through close coordination with national and international agencies engaged in systematic land use planning in Colombia, we are co-designing decision support tools for national scale planning. Examples of specific objectives include:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Holding a series of in-person and virtual workshops with partners and stakeholders throughout the project to build a community of practice focused on systematic land use planning.</li>
                                <li>Leading an effort to co-design decision support tools that will be used by decision makers and other planning agencies in Colombia to identify key areas for conservation, agriculture, and energy development.</li>
                                <li>Working closely with in-country partners to ensure the decision support tool leverages state-of-the-art datasets and analyses and is effective for the envisioned purpose.</li>

                        <p>Effective uptake of research in policy or practice must be built upon a foundation of active knowledge exchange and stakeholder engagement during the research process. What is often lacking though is a systematic appreciation of the specific knowledge exchange practices and their relative merits that make active exchange successful. We are advancing more viable systems of knowledge production that involve decision makers in shaping the research and empirically assessing the effectiveness of co-design for engaged research and assess the nuanced processes decision makers must navigate when planning for natural and social priorities. Examples of specific objectives include: </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Drawing on theory and co-design practices to develop and measure indicators of co-design efficacy.</li>
